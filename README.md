A long time ago, in The 90s far, far away ...

I was still working on
[Tandem NonStop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NonStop_(server_computers))
systems. The filesystem only supported {volume, subvolume, file}. They
did not have make. They did not have ... much of anything. I was
getting tired of configuring test environments and they most certainly
did not have [Puppet](https://puppet.com). So I wrote my
own. Kinda. Not really. But it was fun :)
