A long time ago, in The 90s far, far away ...

I was still working on Tandem
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NonStop_(server_computers) systems. The
filesystem only supported {volume, subvolume, file}. They did not have
make. They did not have ... much of anything. I was getting tired of
configuring test environments and they most certainly did not have
https://puppet.com. So I wrote my own. Kinda. Not really. But it was
fun :)
