A long time ago, in a [Dot.com
bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) far, far away...

I was still working on [Tandem
NonStop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NonStop_(server_computers))
systems. The filesystem only supported {volume, subvolume, file}. They
did not have make. They did not have ... much of anything. I was
getting tired of configuring test environments and they most certainly
did not have [Puppet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_(software))
(not even A Thing In The World until 2005). So I wrote my
own. Kinda. Not really. But it was fun :)
